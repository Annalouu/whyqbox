### ðŸ‘‹ can you briefly explain what this qbox?
::: info + yes, of course.
 While originally forked from <Badge type="danger" text="QBCore" />, many <Badge type="warning" text="Qbox" /> resources have been refactored to improve code quality, enhance security, lower performance overhead, and integrate with <Badge type="tip" text="overextended" /> resources.
:::

### ðŸ‘· do qbcore scripts work in qbox?
::: info + yes, they do.
 We have created a bridge layer for backward compatibility with documented and correct qb-core usage paths, and you can continue to use most QBCore scripts without any changes.
:::

### ðŸ“¦ is the qbox ready to use?
::: info + yes, it is.
 Since qbx_core has backward compatibility with qb-core sources, we recommend using only published Qbox sources for a stable experience.
