## can you briefly explain what this qbox?
::: info 🤷‍♂️ It won't take too much of your time
While originally forked from **QBCore**, many **Qbox resources have been refactored to improve code quality, enhance security, lower performance overhead**, and integrate with **overextended** resources.
:::


## 🤷‍♂️ How **qbox** differs from **qbcore**?
::: info It won't take too much of your time
While originally forked from QBCore, many Qbox resources have been refactored to improve code quality, increase security, reduce performance, and integrate with extended resources. Where appropriate, Qbox also integrates directly with other open source projects, rather than keeping lower-level resources in-house.

Qbox maintains high quality standards with a strong community of regular contributors. As time progresses, you can expect greater differences in features for players.
:::

## 🤷‍♂️ Do qbcore scripts work in qbox?
::: info It won't take too much of your time
Yes (in most cases).

We have created a bridge layer for backward compatibility with documented and correct qb-core usage paths, and you can continue to use most QBCore scripts without any changes.
:::

## 🤷‍♂️ Is the qbox ready to use?
::: info It won't take too much of your time
Since qbx_core has backward compatibility with qb-core sources, we recommend using only published Qbox sources for a stable experience.

```lua
return {
    serverName = 'Server',
    defaultSpawn = vec4(-540.58, -212.02, 37.65, 208.88),
    notifyPosition = 'top-right' -- 'top' | 'top-right' | 'top-left' | 'bottom' | 'bottom-right' | 'bottom-left'
}
```
That is so funny! :joy:
